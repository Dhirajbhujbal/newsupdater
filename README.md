# newsupdater



On app launch app calls the api by using the redux thunk and loads the data (as API is not working I am refering the hardcoded JSON but hardcoded 
JSON which return the data in respective api calls)

On click of next arrow icon app will navigate the use on news details page where all the details will displayed.


for getting the updated news integrated the pull to refresh functionality so to get new data just pull the news list down app will show the updated news on top
